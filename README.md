# MyAdress
I only want to have contact with people that have at least a basic understanding of the field I work in. In this repository you can find a file that needs a password to unlock. The password for this file is my postal code, all you need to solve this is my github profile and this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RM4SCC. Good luck
